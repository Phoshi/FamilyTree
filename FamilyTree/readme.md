Family Tree
===========

This is a simple application that models a family tree style grouping of relationships between people.

Under the GraphImpl directory you will find a generic Directed Graph which depends on the RedBlack tree found under RBTreeImpl 
(Note that anything which implements the supplied ITree interface would be a drop-in replacement, but none are provided)

This was written as my second second year Data Structures and Algorithms assignment.
